        "  - \\* (multiplication)\n",
        "  - / (division)\n",
        "  - // (floor division) => return the the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.\n",
        "  - % (modulo) => the remainder of x  / y\n",
        "  \n",
        "1.  Assignment Operators:\n",
        "  - Used to assign values to variables.\n",
        "  - The most common is the\n",
        "    - simple equal sign (=)\n",
        "    - but Python also has compound assignment operators (augmented assignment operator) for combining some operators with assignment (e.g., +=, -=, *=, /=).\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "weight = 75.4\n",
        "weight += 2.3  # same as weight = weight + 2.3\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Comparison Operators:\n",
        "     - Allow you to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False).\n",
        "    - These are crucial for controlling the flow of your code (we'll talk about that more when you learn about conditional statements).\n",
        "    - Common examples include:\n",
        "      - == (equal to)\n",
        "      - != (not equal to)\n",
        "      - \\> (greater than)\n",

        "      - \\>= (greater than or equal to)\n",
        "      - \\<= (less than or equal to)\n",
        "1.   Logical Operators:\n",
        "  - Work on Boolean values (True or False).\n",
        "  - You can combine multiple comparisons using logical operators to build more complex conditions.\n",
        "  - The main logical operators are:\n",

        "      - or (at least one condition must be True)\n",
        "      - not (reverses the truth value of a condition)\n",
        "1.   Membership Operators:\n",
        "  - Check if a value is present in a sequence (like a list, string, or tuple).\n",
        "  - Examples:\n",
        "    - in (returns True if the value is found)\n",
